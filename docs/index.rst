.. highlight:: bash

This book is a comprehensive resource for SilverStar's Control System for Sewing Machine 
-- for both operators and specialists.

It is not written for a certain model product, but to explain the function,
so here you can't find how to enter the setting interface or connection diagram 
of output and input ports.

The content is organized into three *parts*:

COMMON
  Explain the function, applicable to all products.  

PRODUCT
  Essentials of each product.

The book is :ref:`maintained <devguide>` by SilverStar's devs. It contains information 
and notes intended to ensure long-term and reliable operation. Should you notice any 
discrepancies or if you have improvement requests, then we would be glad to receive 
your feedback.
