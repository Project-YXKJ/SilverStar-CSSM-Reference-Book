This book is a comprehensive resource for SilverStar's Control System for Sewing Machine 
-- for both new and experienced users. 

It is not written for a certain model product, but to explain the function,
so here you can't find how to enter the setting interface or connection diagram 
of output and input ports.

The Content is organized into three *parts*:

COMMON
  Explain the function, applicable to all products.  

PRODUCT
  Essentials of each product.

  Dev

It is :ref:`maintained <devguide>` by SilverStar's devs. We welcome your corrections!
