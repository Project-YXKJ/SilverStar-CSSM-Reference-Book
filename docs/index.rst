SilverStar's CSSM Reference Book
================================

.. highlight:: bash

This book is a comprehensive resource for SilverStar's Control System for Sewing Machine 
-- for both new and experienced users. 

It is not written for a certain model product, but to explain the function,
so here you can't find how to enter the setting interface or connection diagram 
of output and input ports. 

It is :ref:`maintained <devguide>` by SilverStar's devs. We welcome your corrections!
